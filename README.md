# ipnd_rps_starter_code
In this repository you'll find the Python file that contains the starter code for the Rock Paper Scissors project.

Download the `starter_code.py` file, and build your project by adding to that file! When you're done, submit your project by following the instructions in the classroom.

If you want to play with a demo of this project, download one of the `rps_demo` files that ends with the `.pyc` file extension. You should download the file with a number that matches your version of Python. For example, if you have Python 3.7, you should download `rps_demo_37.pyc`. If you run the file with a version of Python that doesn't match, you may get the following error:

```text
RuntimeError: Bad magic number in .pyc file
```

`.pyc` files are _compiled_ Python files. They can be run the same way as `.py` files, by using the `python` or `python3` command in your terminal, along with the name of the file. Like this:

```text
python3 rps_demo_37.pyc
```

But, if you open up this file and try to read it, it won't look like `python` code! Don't worry, the file is fine, we just want you to come up with your own solution to the project. 

Remember, the demo is just there as an example. Your project does **not** have to work identically to the demo!
